### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt, a Year in Industry Mechatronic & Robotic Engineering Student at the University of Sheffield

### This year I will be working for Transport for London as an Engineering & Technology Intern. 

ðŸ”­ I have recently been working on my Masters Group Project, where we were using the Universal Robots UR10e and UR5 to develop a collaborative robotic system to sort different objects. This was using ROS2, Gazebo & MATLAB. Aspects involved included path planning, machine vision and simulation.
