### Hi there 👋, I'm Matt, a 3rd Year Mechatronic & Robotic Engineering Student at the University of Sheffield

### Next year I will be working for Transport for London as an Engineering & Technology Intern for my Year in Industry. 

🔭 I have recently been working on my Masters Group Project, where we were using the Universal Robots UR10e and UR5 to develop a collaborative robotic system to sort different objects. This was using ROS2, Gazebo & MATLAB. Aspects involved included path planning, machine vision and simulation.

🌱 I’m currently learning Digital Signal processing and Machine Learning for use in control system development.

🤔 I’m looking for help with figuring out what to do after my Masters. I intend to do a PhD, but need to figure out where.
